# Projects

A project is a piece of planned work or activity where you can organize and arrange topics that you intend to publish and wish to subscribe to.

It contains connection strings and SSL certifications to set up a connection to MQTT. MQTT stands for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport. It is a publish/subscribe protocol where you can publish and receive messages as a client, often called a “broker”. The job of an MQTT broker is to filter messages based on topic, and then distribute them to subscribers. There is no direct connection between a publisher and subscriber. All clients can publish (broadcast) and subscribe (receive).

To publish your relevant information, you must first create your own project to create a topic and subscribe to your own topic. A topic cannot be duplicated  and cannot published and subscribed to the same project again.

Both publisher and subscriber can create a project. Both publisher and subscriber need to have a project before both can publish or subscribe to any topic. Only the publisher can create a topic.

You can create new project by clicking **Create** button on the top right of the Browse Topics page and select **New Project**.

## Set up MQTT Connections ##

After creating a new project, this tab shows the connection strings and SSL certificates to setup connections to MQTT connections. 

- Unique MQTT URL
- Unique MQTT Client ID
- Client key
- Client secret
- SSL Certificate chain
- SSL Client certificate
- SSL Private key 
- Private key password

  **Note:** *The Private key only appears once. You must copy and save the certificates in a text editor file.*
 
 Alternatively, click **Generate certificate** button to generate new certificate.
  
 You will receive a Private key password through email and use that password in the Client key passphrase field.

A Publisher can create MQTT connection using the certificates generated and with the password from the email inbox.

**Step 4:** Set up MQTT connections with the following:

- MQTT Client Name – Name is not specific and can give random name
- Protocol - Select protocol. For example, *mqtt/tls*
- Host - Enter host name. For example, *sdx.sensors.gov.sg*

- Upload each file you copied in a Text Editor in the following fields: 
  - CA file
  - Client certificate file
  - Client key file

- Enter the password received from the email inbox in the Client key passphrase field
