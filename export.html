<p>This is a 5 minute read that helps you understand most of the in-and-outs of SDX.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-sdx">What is SDX?</h2>

<p><strong>SDX</strong> stands for <strong>Sensors Data Exchange</strong>, a centralized sensor data exchange platform for the Whole-of-Government (WOG). It is part of the Strategic National Project under Smart Nation Solutions Platform (SNSP).</p>

<p><strong>SDX</strong> enables government agencies and individuals to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Publish and subscribe real-time sensor data using a self-service portal both government intranet and government commercial cloud.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Share unclassified (potentially up to restricted) sensor data with government sector organisations and individuals.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-is-my-mqtt-connection-disconnecting">Why is my MQTT connection disconnecting?</h2>

<p>You are using duplicate MQTT Client ID across your different MQTT connection. MQTT Client ID must be unique. You can generate one using a UUID.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-inputs-required-to-connect-to-sdx-broker">What are the inputs required to connect to SDX broker?</h2>

<p>Inputs required to connect to SDX broker:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Unique MQTT Client ID</li>
  <li>Client key</li>
  <li>Client secret</li>
  <li>SSL CA file</li>
  <li>SSL Client cert</li>
  <li>SSL private key</li>

<h2 id="why-my-mqtt-client-cannot-connect-to-sdx">Why my MQTT client cannot connect to SDX?</h2>

<p>Make sure you have provided your IP address for the team to open the firewall.</p>

<p>Check the connection settings on your client and ensure that the passwords are entered correctly.</p>

<p>Check your SSL certificates are in valid format. Refer to this  <a href="https://www.ssl247.com/kb/ssl-certificates/troubleshooting/certificate-matches-private-key">page</a> on how to check.</p>

<p>For example, check the private key file is ok using this command:</p>

<p>openssl rsa –noout –modulus –in <file>.key | openssl md5</file></p>

<h2 id="does-the-topic-pattern-have-a-maximum-length">Does the topic pattern have a maximum length?</h2>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p><strong>Sensor Data Exchange (SDX)</strong> is a centralized data exchange platform for Whole-of-Government (WOG) to provide seamless data sharing and management, and encompass public, private and industrial internet-of-things (IoT) sensors.</p>

<p>This system enables government agencies to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Publish and subscribe (near) real-time sensor data using a self-service portal both government intranet and government commercial cloud.</li>
  <li>Share unclassified (potentially up to restricted) sensor data with government sector organisations and individuals.</li>
</ul>

<p>In SDX, a government agency can act as a publisher to publish information. For example, the National Environment Agency (NEA) may publish and share environment-related information about the weather and air quality.</p>

<h1 id="projects">Projects</h1>

<p>A project is a piece of planned work or activity where you can organize and arrange topics that you intend to publish and wish to subscribe to.</p>

<p>It contains connection strings and SSL certifications to set up a connection to MQTT. MQTT stands for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport. It is a publish/subscribe protocol where you can publish and receive messages as a client, often called a “broker”. The job of an MQTT broker is to filter messages based on topic, and then distribute them to subscribers. There is no direct connection between a publisher and subscriber. All clients can publish (broadcast) and subscribe (receive).</p>

<p>To publish your relevant information, you must first create your own project to create a topic and subscribe to your own topic. A topic cannot be duplicated  and cannot published and subscribed to the same project again.</p>

<p>Both publisher and subscriber can create a project. Both publisher and subscriber need to have a project before both can publish or subscribe to any topic. Only the publisher can create a topic.</p>

<p>You can create new project by clicking <strong>Create</strong> button on the top right of the Browse Topics page and select <strong>New Project</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Fig31.png" alt="Image not Available" /></p>

<p>Or, click <strong>Projects</strong> from the left side navigation bar.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Fig32.png" alt="Image not Available" /></p>

<h2 id="create-new-project">Create New Project</h2>

<p>To create new project:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong>	Click <strong>Create Project</strong>. The Projects page is displayed.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>For your first project, you will see this page as shown below.</em></p>

<p><img src="/assets/Fig33.png" alt="Image not Available" /></p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong>	Enter the following information.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Project Name</li>
  <li>Type of project (For example: Publish, Subscribe)</li>
  <li>Project Duration</li>
  <li>Description</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/Fig34.png" alt="Image not Available" /></p>

<p>The newly created project appears in the <strong>Projects</strong> page &gt; <strong>Overview</strong> tab. Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Fig35.png" alt="Image not Available" /></p>

<p>In the Projects page, displays the project name, date created, number of publication and subscription. It also includes the following tabs:</p>

  <li>Overview – Displays the details of the project.</li>
  <li>Connections – Displays the details to set up and connect to MQTT Client.</li>
  <li>
    <p>My topics – Displays the topic that you have published to this project and the total number of topics published by this project. 
<strong>Note:</strong> <em>This tab is only available for a Publisher only.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>Subscribed topics – Displays the topic that you have subscribed by this project and the total number of topics subscribed by this project.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="set-up-mqtt-connections">Set up MQTT Connections</h2>

<p>After creating a new project, this tab shows the connection strings and SSL certificates to setup connections to MQTT connections.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unique MQTT URL</li>
  <li>Unique MQTT Client ID</li>
  <li>Client key</li>
  <li>Client secret</li>
  <li>SSL Certificate chain</li>
  <li>SSL Client certificate</li>
  <li>SSL Private key</li>
  <li>Private key password</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/Fig36.png" alt="Image not Available" /></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>The Private key only appears once. You must copy and save the certificates in a text editor file.</em></p>

<p>Alternatively, click <strong>Generate certificate</strong> button to generate new certificate.</p>

<p>You will receive a Private key password through email and use that password in the Client key passphrase field.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Fig38.png" alt="Image not Available" /></p>

<p>To set up MQTT Client connection:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong>	Copy the certificates in a Text Editor and save each file separately.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong>	Now, open MQTT Client.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Fig39.png" alt="Image not Available" /></p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click Create MQTT Client.</p>

<p>A Publisher can create MQTT connection using the certificates generated and with the password from the email inbox.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Set up MQTT connections with the following:</p>

<ul>

      <li>CA file</li>
      <li>Client certificate file</li>
      <li>Client key file</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Enter the password received from the email inbox in the Client key passphrase field</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/Fig40.png" alt="Image not Available" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Click <strong>Save</strong> and connected successfully.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/Fig41.png" alt="Image not Available" /></p>

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Using MQTT client, a publisher published a topic.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Copy the topic path and fill into the <strong>Topic to publish</strong> field in MQTT client. For example: <em>govtech-ndmrcHUWg/Topic-temperature</em></li>
  <li>Click <strong>Subscribe</strong> button</li>
  <li>Subscriber is ready to receive data for this topic</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/Fig42.png" alt="Image not Available" /></p>
